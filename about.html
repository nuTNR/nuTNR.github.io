An Introduction to Times New Roman
Welcome and thank you for reading Times New Roman: Comic Sans Edition, Northeastern University’s premiere
satire/comedy newspaper, gazette, digital pamphlet thing-a-majig. Founded sometime in the past, Times
New Roman was Northeastern’s satirical magazine before disbanding sometime in the past, but not so far in the
past that it was before its founding. It was unclear why Times New Roman disbanded, but it was some sketchy
shit. If that’s confusing, don’t worry about it, none of that matters now because were back!
TNR is here to bring satire, stories, and comedy of all variety bi-weekly to further enrich Northeastern. Videos
will also be made and posted on our website if our wonderful writers have a creative spark of genius. At TNR,
we strive to not contain ourselves to one subject, but with the one goal of making readers laugh and make their
day a little better. We know you probably only took this because one of our members gave you a really uncomfortable
look, but we are glad you chose to read! If you give TNR a chance, we can promise a majority of
sub-par jokes and a few adequate ones. By reading Times New Roman, you’ll laugh, you’ll cry (from laughter),
you’ll get angry (with laughter), you’ll die (from laughter!), and a bunch of other stuff. Read and check out our
website if you like what you see! Even if you don,’t give us a chance to redeem ourselves and feel free to give us
any feedback you have!
