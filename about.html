			  <h2>An Introduction to Times New Roman</h2>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">Welcome and thank you for reading Times New Roman: Comic Sans Edition, 
        Northeastern University’s premiere satire/comedy newspaper, gazette, digital thing-a-majig.</p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">Founded sometime in the past, Times New Roman was Northeastern’s satirical magazine before disbanding sometime in the past, but not so far in the
        past that it was before its founding.</p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">It was unclear why Times New Roman disbanded, but it was surely some sketchy shit.</p>
        <h2 style="color:#FF0000">But don’t worry, none of that matters because we're back!</h2>
        TNR is here to bring satire, stories, and comedy of all variety bi-weekly to further enrich Northeastern. Videos
        will also be made and posted on our website if our wonderful writers have a creative spark of genius. At TNR,
        we strive to not contain ourselves to one subject, but with the one goal of making readers laugh and make their
        day a little better. We know you probably only took this because one of our members gave you a really uncomfortable
        look, but we are glad you chose to read! If you give TNR a chance, we can promise a majority of
        sub-par jokes and a few adequate ones. By reading Times New Roman, you’ll laugh, you’ll cry (from laughter),
        you’ll get angry (with laughter), you’ll die (from laughter!), and a bunch of other stuff. Read and check out our
        website if you like what you see! Even if you don,’t give us a chance to redeem ourselves and feel free to give us
        any feedback you have!</p>
