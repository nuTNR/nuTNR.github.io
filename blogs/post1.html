    <h1 style="padding-top:10px;">Analyzing Northeastern's March Madness Prospects</h1>
    <p class="tag-line">By Willy Unterkoefler, Head of Communism</p>
    <p class="tag-line">In collaboration with Shannon Foley, guest writer and sports enthusiast</p>
    <div class="article-body">
    <p>The Northeastern Huskies Men's Basketball team is doing big things this year and recently 
    earned their spot as a 13 seed in the only NCAA tournament that I actually sort of pay 
    attention to and annually lose money trying to predict. In an effort to help my fellow 
    Huskies try to place smart bets this year on Northeastern's tough match against the 
    infamous Kansas Jayhawks, I reached out to my number one source for all things sports. 
    Here's her prediction. Enjoy!</p>
    <p>"I don’t know basketball, but I’ll guess maybe like 86-57 with Kansas winning?
    I think that’s probably a pretty solid guess because basketball courts are really
    small and I feel like those dudes shoot the ball every chance they get even if 
    they’re like 10 feet away (but that’s the point, right? Because then you get a 
    three pointer!). Plus, I mean, 57 points is only 19 three pointers and a game is 
    48 minutes long so that would only be one shot every 2 mins and 30 seconds or so 
    and that should honestly be attainable. For Kansas, I feel like that state does a 
    lot of basketball, so I’m just gonna give then a higher score for no reason (but 
    actually, the reason is that I feel like I associate Kansas with basketball and 
    derbies and rodeos). Anyway, I’m just saying I feel like even though I love this 
    school, we don’t have an outrageously amazing reputation in March Madness, so I don’t
    wanna set my expectations too high. But this way if we do win, then it’ll be that much 
    more exciting because I never thought it’d happen! Again just a guess though." </p>
