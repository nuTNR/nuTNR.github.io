        <p style="color:#FF0000">Thank you for reading Times New Roman: Comic Sans Edition, 
        Northeastern University’s premiere satire/comedy newspaper, gazette, digital thing-a-majig!</p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">Founded sometime in the past, Times New Roman was Northeastern’s satirical magazine before disbanding sometime in the past, but not so far in the
        past that it was before the time in the past when it was founded.</p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">It was unclear why Times New Roman disbanded, but it was surely over some sketchy shit.</p>
        <h2 style="color:#FF0000">But don’t worry, none of that matters because we're back!</h2>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">TNR is here to bring satire, stories, and comedy of every variety bi-weekly to further enrich Northeastern. </p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">You can also expect videos whenever our wonderful writers have a creative spark of genius.</p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">At TNR, we strive to touch on all subjects, with the one goal of making our readers laugh and their day a little better.</p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">We know you're probably only here because one of our members gave you a really uncomfortable look, but we are glad you chose to read!</p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">If you give TNR a chance, we promise you'll find a plethora of sub-par jokes and a few adequate ones.</p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">By reading Times New Roman, you’ll laugh, you’ll cry (from laughter), you’ll get angry (with laughter), you’ll die (from laughter!), and a bunch of other stuff.</p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">Read and check out our videos if you like what you see!</p>
        <p style="color:#FF0000">Even if you don't, give us a chance to redeem ourselves by giving us any feedback you have!</p>
